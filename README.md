# ECommerce

This project is under construction and aims to build an Ecommerce based on what is present in the link
https://learn.microsoft.com/pt-br/dotnet/architecture/cloud-native/introduce-eshoponcontainers-reference-app.

It is a learning project, so it has already been started in microservices architecture.
At this point in the project, the catalog microservice is ready, having its unit and integration tests implemented. This same microservice makes use of the following technologies such as:
  > Kafka;
  > Redis;
  > MongoDB;
  > SQL;
  > Entity Framework;
  > Integration and Unit Tests;
  > Docker and APIs in .NET 7.
